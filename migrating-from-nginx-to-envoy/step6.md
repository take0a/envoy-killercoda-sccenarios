The final configuration is the logging. Instead of piping the error logs to disk, Envoy Proxy follows a cloud-native approach. All the application logs are outputted to _stdout_ and _stderr_.

When users make a request, the access logs are optional and disabled by default. To enable access logs for HTTP requests, include an *`access_log`* configuration for the HTTP Connection Manager. The path can be either a device, such as *stdout*, or a file on disk, depending on your requirements.

The following configuration will pipe all access logs to *`stdout`*. Copy the snippet into the config section for the connection manager:

```yaml
access_log:
- name: envoy.file_access_log
  config:
    path: "/dev/stdout"
```{{copy}}

The results should look like this:

```yaml
      - name: envoy.http_connection_manager
        config:
          codec_type: auto
          stat_prefix: ingress_http
          access_log:
          - name: envoy.file_access_log
            config:
              path: "/dev/stdout"
          route_config:
```

By default, Envoy has a format string that includes details of the HTTP request:

`[%START_TIME%] "%REQ(:METHOD)% %REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)% %PROTOCOL%"
%RESPONSE_CODE% %RESPONSE_FLAGS% %BYTES_RECEIVED% %BYTES_SENT% %DURATION%
%RESP(X-ENVOY-UPSTREAM-SERVICE-TIME)% "%REQ(X-FORWARDED-FOR)%" "%REQ(USER-AGENT)%"
"%REQ(X-REQUEST-ID)%" "%REQ(:AUTHORITY)%" "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"\n`

The result of this format string is:

`[2018-11-23T04:51:00.281Z] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 - 0 58 4 1 "-" "curl/7.47.0" "f21ebd42-6770-4aa5-88d4-e56118165a7d" "one.example.com" "172.18.0.4:80"`

The contents of the output can be customised by setting the format field. For example:

```yaml
access_log:
- name: envoy.file_access_log
  config:
    path: "/dev/stdout"
    format: "[%START_TIME%] "%REQ(:METHOD)% %REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)% %PROTOCOL%" %RESPONSE_CODE% %RESP(X-ENVOY-UPSTREAM-SERVICE-TIME)% "%REQ(X-REQUEST-ID)%" "%REQ(:AUTHORITY)%" "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"\n"
```

The log line can also be outputted as JSON by setting the *json_format* field. For example:
```yaml
access_log:
- name: envoy.file_access_log
  config:
    path: "/dev/stdout"
    json_format: {"protocol": "%PROTOCOL%", "duration": "%DURATION%", "request_method": "%REQ(:METHOD)%"}
```

Logging isn't the only way to gain visibility into production with Envoy Proxy. Advanced tracing and metrics capabilities are built into it. You can find out more in the [tracing documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/observability/tracing) or via the [Interactive Tracing Scenario](https://killercoda.com/envoyproxy-scenarios/scenario/implementing-metrics-tracing).
